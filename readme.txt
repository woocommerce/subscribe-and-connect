"Subscribe & Connect" is a lean plugin that aims to keep it's purpose as clean and clear as possible. Thus, we don't load any forced CSS styling, to allow full control over the styling within your theme or child theme.

Several icon designs are available under the "Settings > Subscribe & Connect > Display" screen, which are entirely optional.
